## Overview

The AWS Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project designed to help individuals showcase their skills in cloud computing, particularly using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The challenge involves creating a web-based resume hosted on AWS that demonstrates proficiency in various AWS services. I took on the cloud résumé challenge using AWS, a multi-layered project designed to develop and showcase essential skills for a career in the cloud. This initiative, crafted by Forest Brazeal, provides a hands-on experience to build and demonstrate expertise in cloud technologies.

## Challenge Requirements

1. **Static Website**: Build a static website to host your resume. This can be a simple HTML page or a more complex site using frameworks like React or Angular.

2. **Amazon S3**: Use Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) to store and serve your website files. Your resume should be accessible via an S3 bucket.

3. **Domain Registration**: Register a custom domain name for your resume. Amazon Route 53 is commonly used for domain registration and DNS management.

4. **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Enable SSL/TLS encryption for your website using Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) to secure the communication between users and your website.

5. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Utilize Amazon CloudFront to set up a CDN to distribute your website content globally, enhancing its performance and reducing latency.

6. **AWS Lambda**: Implement a serverless function using AWS Lambda to automatically update and deploy your resume whenever changes are made to the source code.

7. **Amazon DynamoDB**: Integrate Amazon DynamoDB to store and retrieve dynamic data, such as your professional experience, skills, or projects.

8. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use Infrastructure as Code tools such as AWS CloudFormation or AWS CDK to define and provision the AWS resources required for your project.

9. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy to automate the testing and deployment of your resume updates.

10. **GitHub Actions**: Implement GitHub Actions to automate workflows, such as running tests and deploying your resume, directly from your GitHub repository.

11. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging for your infrastructure using Amazon CloudWatch to gain insights into the performance and health of your AWS resources.


Best of luck with the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge!
